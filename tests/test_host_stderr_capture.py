"""Sentinel test for per-toolkit stderr → log-file routing.

As of 0.4.1 (the Orchestral 1.4 stdio cleanup), the host writes its
stderr directly to ``~/.scitoolkit/logs/<toolkit>.log`` via the
``SCITOOLKIT_HOST_LOG`` env var. Pre-0.4.1, the orchestrator captured
the host's stderr via ``Popen(stderr=PIPE)`` and pumped it to that
same path; with ``MCPClient`` owning the subprocess that lever isn't
available anymore, so the host owns logging.

This test pins the new wiring with a small spawn-a-host check:

1. Set ``SCITOOLKIT_HOST_LOG`` to a tmp path.
2. Run ``_redirect_stderr_to_log`` as the host's main() does at startup.
3. Write a known string to ``sys.stderr``.
4. Restore the original stderr and confirm the string landed in the
   log file.

If a future change breaks this path — say someone "simplifies" the
redirect or moves it later in main() — this sentinel fails loudly
and the per-toolkit logging regression is caught at unit-test time
rather than at user-debugs-a-mystery time.
