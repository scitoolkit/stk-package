"""End-to-end test for the orchestrator's auto-restart machinery.

Drives the ``Orchestrator`` class in-process against a real per-toolkit
host subprocess that deliberately crashes itself with ``os._exit(1)``
inside one of its tools. Verifies:

1. **Crash + recovery.** A call to ``crash_now`` kills the host
   subprocess. The forwarder detects the connection-class error,
   schedules a restart, and returns the "restart scheduled" message.
   After the backoff window, the runtime is back in READY state and a
   call to ``still_alive`` returns "ok" from a fresh subprocess.

2. **Permanent failure.** Crashing the host four times exhausts the
   3-attempt restart budget. The 4th call returns the "marked failed
   for this serve session" message.

We monkeypatch ``RESTART_BACKOFF_S`` to short delays for the
permanent-failure scenario so the harness completes in seconds, not the
21 s the production schedule would take.

Why in-process: this exercises the orchestrator's restart logic end-to-end
against a real subprocess that really dies, without the cost (or
patching difficulty) of spawning ``scitoolkit serve`` as an outer
subprocess. The serve-stdio layer is already covered by ``run_serve_e2e.py``.
