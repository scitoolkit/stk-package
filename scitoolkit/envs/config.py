"""
Two-layer per-toolkit config resolution.

Each toolkit's effective config is the merge of:

- *User layer*: ``~/.scitoolkit/config/<toolkit>.yaml``. User-facts that
  follow them across projects (API keys, data paths on this machine).
- *Project layer*: ``<project>/.scitoolkit/config/<toolkit>.yaml``.
  Project-scoped overrides (different opacity table per analysis, etc.).

Project wins key-by-key. Keys only in user survive. Keys only in project
are merged in. The ``schema_version`` envelope from either file is
stripped before the merge — it's a file-format concern, not a config
value, and serve/setup never inject it as state.

Phase 1 ships the resolver; Phase 4 wires it into the orchestrator's
``_resolve_state_config`` flow alongside the existing 3C contract
(NEEDS_VALUE sentinel, etc.). No CLI behavior changes here.

        Merged dict of effective config values. Empty dict if neither
        layer has a file. ``schema_version`` is not included in the
        returned dict.

    Merge semantics:
        - Shallow per-key. Nested mappings under a single key get
          replaced wholesale, not deep-merged. This matches the
          existing Phase 3C config shape (flat ``{field: value}``).
          If a future field requires nested structure with
          per-subkey override semantics, that's a per-field decision
          to surface explicitly; not assumed here.
        - Project values override user values key-by-key.
        - Keys only in one layer survive intact.

    Note on Phase 3C ``<NEEDS VALUE>`` sentinels:
        The sentinel is just a string. If the user layer has
        ``api_key: "<NEEDS VALUE>"`` and the project layer has
        ``api_key: "real-key"``, the project wins and the sentinel
        is overridden. If both layers have the sentinel, the
        sentinel propagates and serve's existing 3C "config
        incomplete" gate fires. This is correct: the sentinel is
        data, just structured data, and the resolver doesn't need
        to special-case it.
