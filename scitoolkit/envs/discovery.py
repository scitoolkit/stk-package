"""
Project-root discovery walk.

Behavior (per the 0.5.0 brief):

1. Walk upward from ``cwd`` looking for ``.scitoolkit/manifest.yaml``.
   Stop at the first hit; return that directory as the project root.
2. If none found, fall back to ``default_project_root()``.
3. An explicit ``override`` (the ``--project-dir <path>`` CLI flag)
   short-circuits both above.

All-pure-function, with ``cwd`` and ``override`` injectable so the
discovery logic is testable without changing the real working directory.
Phase 1 ships this substrate; Phase 3 wires the CLI flag.

    Returns the directory containing the ``.scitoolkit/`` directory
    (NOT the ``.scitoolkit/`` directory itself). If the override is
    given, returns ``override.resolve()`` immediately. If no manifest
    is found anywhere up to the filesystem root, returns ``None``
    (caller decides whether to fall back to the default-project).

    The walk stops at the filesystem root (``Path("/")`` on POSIX,
    the drive root on Windows). It does NOT cross filesystem
    boundaries explicitly — symlinks are followed via ``resolve()``.
