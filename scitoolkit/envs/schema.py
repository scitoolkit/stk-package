"""
Schema versioning plumbing for every YAML file SciToolkit writes from 0.5.0
forward.

Every file we write carries ``schema_version: <int>`` at the top. On read:

- If a file's ``schema_version`` is missing, we assume ``0`` (legacy
  layer, pre-0.5.0 files like Phase 3C's ``~/.scitoolkit/config/<toolkit>.yaml``).
- If ``schema_version`` is in range ``[0, MAX_SCHEMA_VERSION[file_type]]``,
  we read the file, then run any registered migrations from that version
  forward to the current ``MAX`` for that file type.
- If ``schema_version > MAX``, we refuse with ``SchemaTooNewError`` —
  "your scitoolkit is older than this config file."

The migration framework ships **empty** in 0.5.0. The pattern is in
place so 0.6.0 (or later) can register the first non-trivial migration
without rewriting how files are read.

File modes are NOT set here; ``write_versioned_yaml`` writes atomically
and the caller's storage layer (the existing ``setup/storage.py``
pattern) is the right place to chmod 0600.
