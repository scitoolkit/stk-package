"""
Tier-1 install-time runner and serve-time state-config resolver.

Two entry points:

- ``run_install_setup(name, schema, mode)`` — called from
  ``scitoolkit install`` after env setup. Walks the schema, prompts
  the user (TTY) or fills in defaults (non-TTY), writes
  ``~/.scitoolkit/config/<name>.yaml``. Always succeeds: required
  fields the user can't supply land as ``NEEDS_VALUE_SENTINEL`` and
  ``serve`` will refuse the toolkit until they're filled.

- ``load_state_config(name, schema)`` — called from
  ``serve/orchestrator.py`` at startup. Reads the YAML, validates each
  filled field against its schema entry, returns
  ``(state_config_dict, missing_or_invalid)``. The orchestrator passes
  the dict via ``--state-config`` to the toolkit subprocess, where
  ``_inject_state_into_tools`` writes it onto the tool instances.

The shape of the state-config dict (per Item 3 sketch sign-off
2026-05-06): **flat** — ``{state_field_name: value}``. Not nested
per-tool. One toolkit's config applies across every tool in that
toolkit.
