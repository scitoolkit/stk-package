"""
File-canonical YAML storage for toolkit config.

Two-layer (Phase 4, 0.5.0):

- *User layer* (the legacy, default): ``~/.scitoolkit/config/<toolkit>.yaml``.
  Per-machine identity (API keys, data paths).
- *Project layer* (new): ``<project>/.scitoolkit/config/<toolkit>.yaml``.
  Per-project overrides; keys override the user layer key-by-key.

Every read / write function takes an optional ``layer`` argument
(``"user"`` or ``"project"``). When ``layer="project"``, a
``project_root`` must be supplied — there is no implicit default.
Backward compatibility: omitting ``layer`` resolves to ``"user"`` (the
0.4.x behavior).

This module is the read/write layer. It uses ``ruamel.yaml`` so user
comments survive ``set`` / ``unset`` round-trips — without that, every
``scitoolkit config set`` would silently strip the user's notes.

Resolver pattern (HANDOFF gotcha #12): functions take ``base:
Optional[Path] = None`` and resolve in-body via ``_resolve_config_dir()``,
which re-reads from the ``config`` module each call. This is what makes
test fixtures work — patching ``scitoolkit.config.CONFIG_DIR`` to a
tmp dir is enough to redirect the entire config-storage surface.
Don't "simplify" back to a bound default; the naive form silently
writes tests' config into the developer's real ``~/.scitoolkit/``.

File mode is ``0600`` because the file may contain secrets. (Project-
layer files use the same mode for consistency, even though they're
intended to be checked into git — if a user writes a secret to the
project layer, the file permissions are still tight.)

The exposed surface:

- ``config_dir()`` — the directory ``~/.scitoolkit/config/``.
- ``config_path(name, *, layer="user", project_root=None)`` — full path
  for one toolkit's config in the given layer.
- ``load_config(name, *, layer="user", project_root=None)`` — read.
- ``save_config(name, data, *, layer="user", project_root=None)`` — write.
- ``set_config_value(name, key, value, *, layer="user", project_root=None)``.
- ``unset_config_value(name, key, *, layer="user", project_root=None)``.
- ``delete_config(name, *, layer="user", project_root=None)`` — remove file.
