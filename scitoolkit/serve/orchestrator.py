"""
Orchestrator for ``scitoolkit serve`` (MVP, ``--no-tui`` mode only).

Responsibilities:

1. Discover installed toolkits via ``~/.scitoolkit/toolkits/*/.stk_meta.json``.
2. Classify each as ready / skipped (docker, needs_setup, broken).
3. Print a scannable startup banner.
4. Spawn one subprocess per ready toolkit, using that toolkit's interpreter.
5. Read each subprocess's handshake (port + tool list) from its stdout.
6. Connect an MCPClient (HTTP) to each subprocess.
7. Build proxy tools (namespaced ``<toolkit>__<tool>``) and aggregate them.
8. Start ``orchestral.mcp.MCPServer`` on stdio (Claude Code talks to it).
9. On shutdown, send graceful → SIGTERM → SIGKILL to children.

Out of scope for the MVP (deferred per direction):

- Per-call timeout enforcement (relies on MCPClient's default).
- TUI-facing event subscription API.
- Hot reload.

Implemented post-MVP:

- Auto-restart of crashed per-toolkit subprocesses with exponential
  backoff (1s, 4s, 16s; budget 3). See §3.3 of SERVE_ARCHITECTURE.md.

See ``stk-package/docs/SERVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`` for the full design.
