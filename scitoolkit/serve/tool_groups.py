"""
Conditional tool-group availability for ``scitoolkit serve``.

A toolkit may declare a ``tool_groups:`` block in its ``toolkit.yaml``:

    tool_groups:
      pdg: {}
      mg5: {requires: [mg5_path]}
      feynrules: {requires: [wolframscript_path, feynrules_path]}

Each group can declare ``requires: [<config_key>, ...]`` referencing
keys in the same toolkit's ``config:`` block. At serve startup, after
the two-layer (user → project) toolkit config has been resolved, each
group is evaluated:

- If every key in its ``requires:`` list is set to a non-empty,
  non-``<NEEDS VALUE>`` value in the resolved config, the group is
  *available*.
- Otherwise, the group is *unavailable* and tools whose ``group:``
  field names it are silently dropped from the served tool list.

Tools without a ``group:`` field are always served — the gating only
applies to tools explicitly opted into a group. Toolkits without a
``tool_groups:`` block keep working exactly as in 0.5.0 (no gating).

The validation rule that every ``requires:`` key is declared in the
toolkit's ``config:`` block is enforced at publish time
(``validation.ToolkitMetadata._validate_tool_groups``), not here —
this module trusts that what it sees has already been validated.

This module is pure (no I/O); the orchestrator wires it into
``_launch_one`` after ``_resolve_state_config``.
