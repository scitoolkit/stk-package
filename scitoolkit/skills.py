"""Skills surfacing.

A toolkit's ``skills/*.md`` files are agent-facing how-to guides. On
install, we mirror them into ``~/.claude/skills/`` so Claude Code (which
watches that directory) picks them up automatically. On uninstall, we
remove them. On publish, we validate that they carry the frontmatter
Claude Code expects.

The mirror layout is:

    ~/.claude/skills/<toolkit>__<skill_name>/SKILL.md

Each skill gets its own directory. Namespacing the directory name with
``<toolkit>__`` mirrors the tool-namespacing convention and prevents
collisions with skills from other toolkits or unrelated installations.

This module deliberately uses *copies*, not symlinks, even though the
original spec said "symlink." Copies survive ``rm -rf`` of the toolkit
dir cleaner (orphan symlinks are confusing); they survive Windows; and
the source files are tiny markdown so the disk cost is negligible. We
still call the operation "surfacing" to match user-facing terminology.

If the user has manually placed something in
``~/.claude/skills/<toolkit>__<skill>/`` we won't blow it away on
install — we only overwrite ``SKILL.md`` itself.
